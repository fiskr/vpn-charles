These scripts are provided with no warranty what-so-ever. They've worked for me a little
bit, and that's all I can say. Don't be in the habit of grabbing random stuff off the
internet and running it as root. Don't blame me if it eats your system.

./edit-search-domains.rb
	A ruby script for Mac OSX that you can run to add or remove search domains
	from your path. (Must be run as root). You can check your search domains
	just by running scutil --dns. Works when you're on a wireless or wired
	network, or on a Juniper VPN. Uses scutil under the hood.

./vpn-charles.rb
	When you run Charles after starting Juniper's SSL VPN client (Network Connect) it sets
	the proxy settings, but onto your primary interface instead of the VPN interface. This
	script copies the config entries over to the VPN interface. So you can start the VPN,
	start charles, then run ./vpn-charles.rb --on and it will make Charles work. If you
	shut Charles down, just run ./vpn-charles.rb --off to disable proxying.

These both use scutil.
